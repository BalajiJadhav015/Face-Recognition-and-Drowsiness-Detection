# Face-Recognition-and-Drowsiness-Detection
The Indian education landscape has been undergoing rapid changes for the past 10 years. Owing to the advancement of web-based learning services, specifically, eLearning platforms. Although the market is growing on a rapid scale. There are major challenges associated with digital learning when compared with brick and mortar classrooms.One of many challenges is how to ensure quality learning for students.In a physical classroom during a lecturing teacher can see the faces and assess the emotion of the class. Lecturer tune their lecture accordingly, whether he is going fast or slow. He can identify students who need special attention.

Due to distance education there is a gap created between student and teacher with less interaction and no physical presence grasping of the students becomes very less. To tackle this problem we can accesses to the video and images of images and we will come to know which student is alert in class.

Face recognition and drowsiness detection  

The definition of face detection refers to computer technology that is able to identify the presence of people’s faces within digital images. Face recognition describes a biometric technology that goes way beyond recognizing when a human face is present. It actually attempts to establish whose face it is. The process works using a computer application that captures a digital image of an individual’s face. The entire architecture is divided into 6 modules.Face Detection,Eye Detection,Face Tracking,Eye Tracking,Drowsiness Detection,Distraction Detection 

## Conclusion
Due to distance education students are not getting motivated with traditional way of teaching with pen and paper it is more impactful. With the help of this model we will able to connect to students more precisely and with more effectiveness. 
As soon as student get distracted it will come to know to us. we can take actions according to that with the help of these systems. It will be beneficial to both students as well as teachers.
